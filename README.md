Am tasked to create models to predict the houses based on the given predictor variables.

I used five approaches for this:
Multiple linear regression
Quantile regression
Ridge regression
Lasso regression
ElasticNet regression

Dataset Columns:
Id 
price  - Price of the house
bedrooms - Number of Bedrooms
bathrooms - Number of Bathrooms
sqft_living - Square feet area of living area
sqft_lot  - Square feet area of parking Layout
floors - Number of Floors
waterfront - Whether waterfront is there or not
view - Number of Views
grade - Grades
sqft_above
sqft_basement - Square feet area off basement
yr_built - Year the house is built
yr_renovated - Year the house is renovated
zipcode - zipcode os the house
lat : Latitude of the house
lon : Longitude of the house
sqft_living15
sqft_lot15

Steps during the study

Read and exploring the dataset.
Define the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question.
Find and deal with outliers, anomalies and missing data within the dataset.
Perform univariate, bivariate and multi-variate analysis recording observations.
Check for multi-collinearity.
Performing regression analysis.
Providing the receommendation based on the analysis.
Challenging the solution by providing insights on how to make model improvements.
